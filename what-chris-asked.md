# What Chris Asked

## Initial Questions and Comments

1. "What is the piece of code that selects a value? I'm investigating a bug but don't want any help with it until I ask and identify the cause"

2. "Something is off with getSelectedWheelName I can see that D is selected but the logic has decided that is C"

3. "Can you help with this"

4. "The segments are variable depending on the size of nameArr"

5. "Still seeing an issue, note on the image that ABC has landed at 12 o'clock but the debugger shows STU was actually located which is between 180 and 270 degrees on that circle"

6. "It's still off - I saw it land on b and select A"

7. "Still off"

8. "And is that an approach that is actually good practice, covers multiple numbers of segments too if your degrees are out, that fixed segment stuff ONLY works if there's 6 segments left in the wheel"

9. "Still seeing an issue, note on the image that ABC has landed at 12 o'clock but the debugger shows STU was actually located which is between 180 and 270 degrees on that circle"

10. "It is still off - B is selected by the arrow but E at the bottom left is the returned array value"

11. "G is selected on the wheel with the arrow now and E is returned debugging. We need to break this down more. The wheel "boosts" almost when Stop is clicked. Is that maths the problem or calculating how far the wheel has rotated"

12. "Ok that's perfect, it's working now! Can you summarise our conversation and save it to a Markdown File. This is to show new apprentices the path to the bug fix. Summarise my thought process and where I got to and then what the fixes were."

13. "Add common files to the gitignore please"

14. "Can you record my questions in a file what-chris-asked.md too, don't reword them please just as is"
